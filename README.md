The goal of `pltest` is to provide a secure autograder for the
[PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl) platform.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/illinois-r/pltest) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("illinois-r/pltest")
```

## Development Status

Workflow with this package is highly experimental and is likely to be
tuned over the next school year. That said, using the templates in the
package now with PrairieLearn will likely be fine.

## Motivation

The goal behind this package is to abstract away portions of the code
required to be executed inside a course.

## License

Portions of the code related to PrairieLearn are released under:

GPL (\>= 2)
